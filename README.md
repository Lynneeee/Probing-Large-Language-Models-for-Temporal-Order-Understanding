# Probing-Large-Language-Models-for-Temporal-Order-Understanding


This repository holds the code for my master thesis entitled “Probing-Large-Language-Models-for-Temporal-Order-Understanding” written at the University of Groningen.

# Seed Dataset

We created two seed datasets. The sentences in the datasets satisfy the condition that there are two clauses and that the event described in the first clause occurs before the second clause. The difference between the two datasets is that one has the same subject of the two clauses and the other has a different subject of the two clauses.

# Datasets related with probes
We modified the seed dataset according to the goal of each probe and obtained three kinds of datasets.(Two for each one)
